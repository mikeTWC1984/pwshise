## Fonts 

Before opening nvim download and install Nerd fonts to display icons properly. Otherwise disable
devicons plugin. If you are remoting or using docker, you only need to install fonts on the host (local) machine.

Download ttf/otf files from https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts , then click on the file to install

You can also use FontInstaller.ps1 script to automated this.

Fonts might look different on different OS/terminals. You can start with [DejaVuSansMono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/DejaVuSansMono/Regular/complete) font, it looked OK on all tested machines. 

Once font is installed, go to your terminal preferences and set the new font (it should have Nerd Font or NF prefix).
